## Chore Tracker ((SLOOOOOOOW DOOOOOOWN))

I am a father of 2 wonderful children. Malachi (8), Mavis (7).

I want to instill a sense of ownership of their ever changing responsibilities. 

As much as I'd love to assign them support tickets in Jira, I just don't think that is the tool for the job. 

We've done chore charts in the past, but they are hard to edit, take up lots of space, and once they don't have the flexibility and storage of a database to store a historical record

Built with:
    React, Redux, Redux-Sagas, Express, Material UI, scheduling the recurring chores with Cron.

Challenges I overcame:
    New Server side library in cron that needs to alway run and make sql queries. Figuring out how to integrate that for my specific use case. 

1 thing to tackle
    Parent dashboard that shows the current day's chores for the whole family and who has completed what.

Thanks!
